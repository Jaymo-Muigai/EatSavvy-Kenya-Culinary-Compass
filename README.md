Food and Drinks (Restaurants) Analysis and Recommendation System in Kenya
## Background:
You are tasked with developing an analysis and recommendation system for food and drinks (Restaurants) establishments in Kenya.  The dataset should contain information about restaurants, customer reviews, ratings, cuisines, and other attributes. Your objective to analyze the (Restaurants) food and drinks scene in Kenya and provide recommendations for similar establishments based on user preferences.
Project Tasks:
## Data Acquisition and Cleaning:
Obtain a dataset containing information about food and drinks establishments in Kenya.
Apply data cleaning algorithms to organize and preprocess the dataset for analysis.
## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Utilize data visualization algorithms to explore the characteristics of food and drinks establishments in Kenya.
Analyze top-rated, most-reviewed, and highly-followed establishments to identify trends and patterns.
## Hypothesis Testing:
Formulate hypotheses related to the attributes of food and drinks establishments in Kenya, such as ratings, cost, or cuisine preferences.
Use statistical methods and hypothesis testing techniques to validate or refute these hypotheses.
## Feature Engineering:
Create new features such as mean rating, mean reviews, and mean followers for each establishment.
Implement feature scaling techniques to normalize the features.
## Content-Based Recommendation System:
Adapt the existing content-based recommendation system to suggest similar food and drinks establishments based on user input.
Train the recommendation model on the dataset of Kenyan establishments and evaluate its performance.
## Integration with External Data Sources:
Explore the possibility of integrating external data sources such as local reviews, social media data, or geographic information to enhance the recommendation system.
## Testing and Validation:
Validate the recommendation system using test cases and real user feedback.
Assess the performance of the system in providing relevant and accurate recommendations for food and drinks establishments in Kenya.
## Documentation and Presentation:
Document each step of the project, including data preprocessing, hypothesis testing, and recommendation system implementation.
Prepare a comprehensive report summarizing the findings, insights, and recommendations.
Present the project (One month Project)
## Guidelines:
Utilize Python programming language for data preprocessing, EDA, hypothesis testing, Machine Learning and any other recommendation system implementation.
Consider integrating MySQL for database management if necessary, ensuring efficient storage and retrieval of data.
Test the recommendation system rigorously and validate its performance using both quantitative and qualitative metrics.
